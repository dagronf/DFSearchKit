# DFSearchKit
A basic wrapper around SKSearchKit in Swift

## Why?
I was interesting in learning about SKSearchKit, and there was a lack of (simple) working examples to play with.

## Usage

The base library is split into three classes

### DFSKIndex

Core indexing library, wrapper around SKIndex and related methods.  Generally, you won't need to use this class directly unless you want to interface to your own SKIndex object.

### DFSKDataIndex

A class, inheriting from DFSKIndex that uses an in-memory search index.

#### Basic example

```
if let indexer = DFSKDataIndex.create()
{
	indexer.add(URL(string: ("doc-url://d1.txt"))!, text: "This is my first document"))
	indexer.add(url: URL(string: "file://tmp/mypdf.pdf", mimeType: "application/pdf"))
	indexer.flush()
	let searchresult = indexer.search("first")
	...
}
```

### DFSKFileIndex

A class, inheriting from DFSKIndex that allows the creation and use of an index on disk

#### Basic example

```
if let indexer = DFSKFileIndex.create(with: file.fileURL)
{
	indexer.add(URL(string: ("doc-url://d1.txt"))!, text: "This is my first document"))
	indexer.flush()
	var result = indexer.search("first")
	indexer.save()
	indexer.close()
}
```

## Searching

There are two methods for search

### Search all
The search all is available on the indexer object, and returns all the results it can get.  As such, for large indexes this may take quite a while to return.  It is provided mostly as a convenience function for small indexes.

```
if let indexer = DFSKDataIndex.create()
{
	indexer.add(URL(string: ("doc-url://d1.txt"))!, text: "This is my first document"))
	indexer.flush()
	var result = indexer.search("first")
	indexer.save()
	indexer.close()
}
```

### Search progressive
For large indexes, the results may take quite a while to return.  Thus, the progressive index is more useful by returning limited sets of results progressively, and can be used on a background thread (as SKSearchIndex is thread safe) to progressively retrieve results in another thread (for example)

```
	let search = DFSKIndex.ProgressiveSearch(indexer, query: "dog")
	... load documents ...
	var hasMoreResults = true
	repeat
	{
		var searchChunk = search.next(10)
		... do something with searchChunk...
		hasMoreResults = searchChunk.moreResults
	}
	while hasMoreResults
```

## Samples

* `SearchToy` is a (very!) basic UI to show integration
* `dfskindex` is a simple command line tool (that is very unforgiving to its parameters at this point!) that uses DFSKFileIndex to create a command line tool interface to the index

## Tests

`DFSKIndexTests.swift` and `DFSKSummaryTests.swift` contain a small number of tests (so far) that can be used to see how it works

## Todo

Asynchronous search, lots of other stuff! This is a learning project only. Maybe it will be useful to someone
