# DFSearchKit
A basic wrapper around SKSearchKit in Swift

## Why?
I was interesting in learning about SKSearchKit, and there was a lack of (simple) working examples to play with.

## Usage

`DFSearchKitTests.swift` contains a small number of tests (so far) that can be used to see how it works

## Todo

Asynchronous search, lots of other stuff! This is a learning project only. Maybe it will be useful to someone 

## Thanks
